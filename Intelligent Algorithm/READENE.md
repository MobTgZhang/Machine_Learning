**# SA:Annealing algorithm #**
Simulated annealing arithmetic originates from the principle of solid annealing. The solid is heated to a full height and then cooled slowly. When heated, the particles inside the solid become disordered and the internal energy increases, while the particles gradually become ordered and reach equilibrium at each temperature, and finally reach the ground state at normal temperature, and the internal energy decreases to the minimum. According to Metropolis criterion, the probability of equilibrium of particles at temperature T is e^\frac{\deltaE}{kT}, where E is the internal energy at temperature T, \deltaE is the change amount and K is the Boltzmann constant. The simulated combinatorial optimization problem is simulated by solid annealing. The internal energy E is simulated as the objective function value f and the temperature T is evolved into the control parameter t. The simulated annealing algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem is obtained. Starting from the initial solution I and the initial value t of the control parameter, the iteration of "generating new solution calculating the difference of the objective function accepting or discarding" is repeated for the current solution, and the value t is gradually attenuated, and the current solution at the end of the algorithm is obtained This is a heuristic stochastic search process based on Monte Carlo iteration method. The annealing process is controlled by the Cooling Schedule, including the initial value t of the control parameter and its attenuation factor \deltat, the number of iterations L for each t value and the stopping condition S.
